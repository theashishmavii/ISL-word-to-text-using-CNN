# 🖐 ISL Word to Text using CNN  

## 📌 Overview  

This project implements a **Sign Language Word Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
It enables **real-time and image-based recognition** of **131 Indian Sign Language (ISL) words**, converting them into **text**.  

This model is useful for bridging the **communication gap** between **sign language users and non-signers**.  

---

## 📌 Why This Project?  

Millions of individuals rely on **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** for communication, yet **most people** do not understand it.  
This creates a **barrier** in education, workplaces, and daily life.  

🔹 This project **aims to remove this barrier** by developing an **AI-based real-time translator** for ISL words.  

✅ **Improves accessibility** for individuals with hearing & speech impairments  
✅ **Encourages inclusivity** by helping non-signers understand ISL  
✅ **Can be used for AI assistants, education, and smart translation tools**

## 📌 Features  

✔ **Recognizes 131 ISL Words**  
✔ **Works with both images & real-time video**  
✔ **CNN-based deep learning model**  
✔ **Pretrained model for faster inference**  
✔ **Supports training on custom datasets**  
✔ **Scalable for other sign languages**
